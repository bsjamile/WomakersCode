Content = HTML
    HTML file - content and page structure
Style = CSS
    CSS file - presentation and styling 
Business Logic = JavaScript files
    JavaScript file - behaviors and interactivity

- By Styling elements in HTML using CSS, you can simplify the formatting for the pages by applying CSS styles to all the elements on a page, regardless of the page complexity, rather than coding the appearance within each HTML elements. In addition, you can link multiple HTML pages to a single CSS file, which can help simplify a conssitente look and feel across the entire website.

- Setting up three files helps keep the website project organiized. The separation of content, styles and logic is an example of progressive enhancement (avan√ßo progressivo). If JavaScript isn't enabled or supported by the customers, the CSS and HTML will still work. However, if CSS isn't supported by the customers, at least your HTML content will appear.
